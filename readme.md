This is my introduction to PHP (technically, a refresher)

Where we have a [file](thisIsPHP.php) that includes

>Initiating
>echo
>print
>syntax
>ending ;
>single line comments
>multi  line comments

```php
<?php
    echo "This is a PHP file";
    print "Hello World!";
    //This is a PHP file

    /*this is a PHP file 
    with a multiline comment */
?>
```
